=== Getting Started Lab II

==== Objective

Review redirection, pipes, filters and job control.

==== Redirection

Perform the following redirection related operations.

  1. Perform a file copy using the `cat` command and redirection
     operators.
  2. Join the 3 files `elements1.txt`, `elements2,txt`, `elements3.txt`
     into a single file using a single `cat` command and the
     redirection operator.
  3. Join the 3 files using multiple `cat` commands and the redirection
     with append operator.

------
$ cat < cities.txt > copy.txt

$ cat elements1.txt elements2.txt elements3.txt > concat1.txt

$ cat elements1.txt > concat2.txt
$ cat elements2.txt >> concat2.txt
$ cat elements3.txt >> concat2.txt
------

==== Pagers

  * Display the file `elements.txt` using the command `more`.
  * Display the file `elements.txt` using the command `less`.

==== `head` and `tail`

The file `cities.txt` contains the 10 largest cities in the world (by
population). Perform the following operations using `head` and `tail`.

  1. Display the largest city in the world.
  2. Display the 10th largest city in the world.
  3. Display the 3rd largest city in the world.
  
------
$ cat cities.txt | head -n 1

$ cat cities.txt | tail -n 1

$ cat cities.txt | head -n 3 | tail -n 1
------

==== `cut` and `sort`

The file `elements.txt` contains the list of elements and their
abbreviation. Perform the following operations on `elements.txt`,
using `cut` and `sort`.

  1. Sort all elements in `elements.txt` on the basis of abbreviation.
  2. Display only the element names in `elements.txt`.

==== Job Control

  1. Run `sleep 20`, suspend and resume it in the foreground.
  2. Run `sleep 20`, suspend and resume it in the background.
  3. Start `sleep 20` in the background.
  4. Start multiple `sleep 20` in the background, kill a `sleep`
     process with the kill command, verify using `jobs`.

$ sleep 20
^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 sleep 20
$ fg

$ jobs
[2]+  Running                 sleep 20 &
------

==== Processes

Perform the following process related operations at the shell prompt.

  1. List all the processes in the system.
  2. List all processes belonging to `root`.
  3. List all processes corresponding to the program `getty`.
  4. List the process tree of the system.
