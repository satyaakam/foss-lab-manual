  2. Learn to create widgets and associate callbacks.

==== Required Reading

  * 'Getting Started' and 'Movin On' sections of the
    http://www.pygtk.org/pygtk2tutorial/index.html[PyGTK 2.0 Tutorial]

  * 'ComboBox Widget' section of the
    http://www.pygtk.org/pygtk2tutorial/index.html[PyGTK 2.0 Tutorial]

==== Hello World

Write a Python script that creates a button with the text "Hello
World".

------
include::gui-programming/hello-world-py-gtk.py[]
------

==== Callbacks

Extend the previous script, such that "Hello World" is printed when
the user click on the button.

------
include::gui-programming/button-py-gtk.py[]
------

==== More Signals

Write a Python script that creates a combo-box with three
elements. When the selection is changed the selected item is to be
printed.

Tip: The `gtk.combo_box_new_text()` helper function creates a
combo-box. The `append_text()` method can be used to add entries to
the combo-box. The combo-box emits the `changed` signal when the
combo-box selection changes.
