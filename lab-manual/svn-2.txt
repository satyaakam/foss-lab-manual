==== Objective

  * Learn to resolve conflicts.
  * Learn to view history.
  * Learn to add and remove files.
  * Learn to checkout previous versions from the repo.

==== Required Reading

  * Section 'Basic Usage' of the book

==== Conflicts

Perform the following steps to create a conflict and resolve the
conflict.

 1. There word "neighbour" is missing in chapter 1, line 24. Goto
    checkout B, in chapter 1, line 24, replace ??? with
    "neighbour". Commit your change

 2. Goto checkout A, and replace ??? with "neighbor", the American
    spelling. The change cannot be committed, since it is not the
    latest revision of the file.

 3. Do an update, it will result in a conflict.

 4. Resolve the conflict and commit.

.Step 1: Make a change in checkout B

Ensure you are in checkout B. Edit `chapter-1.txt`, replace ??? in
line 24 with `neighbour`. Commit your change.

.Step 3: Retrieve updates from the repo

Perform an update, to retrieve the latest version of the
`chapter-1.txt` from the repo. Since the local file and the remote
file have been modified in the same line, this will result in a
conflict.

------
$ svn update
C    chapter-1.txt
Updated to revision 5.
------

.Step 4: Resolve the conflict

Edit `chapter-1.txt` and look for the following conflict marker. 

------
<<<<<<< .mine
    * The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor
=======
    * The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbour
>>>>>>> .r5
------

Keep one of the lines. Remove the conflict markers. Use the `resolved`
sub-command to clear the conflict state. And commit the changes.
