prompt.

  1. Get a list of files in the current directory.
  2. Create a directory called `foss`.
  3. Delete the directory `foss`
  4. Create the following directory structure with a single command:
     `one/two/three`.
  5. Delete the directory `one` with all its sub directories.
  6. Print the path of current working directory.

==== Hidden files

Perform the following hidden files related operations at the shell
prompt.

  1. Create a hidden file called `.a`.
  2. Create a hidden directory called `.config`.
  3. List all the files in the current directory including hidden
     files.

----
$ touch .a

$ mkdir .config

$ ls -a
.       ..      .a      .config

==== Multiple Files

The directory `pattern` has files with names containing specific
patterns. Perform the following operations on the files.

  1. Goto the directory `pattern`.
  2. Remove all files starting with `a`.
  3. Remove files ending with `1.txt`.
  4. Remove all files start with `doc` and ending with `.txt`.
  5. Remove all files.

-------
$ cd pattern

$ rm a*

$ rm *1.txt

$ rm doc*.txt

$ rm *
-------

==== Shell Variables

Perform the following shell variable related operations at the shell
prompt.

  * Store the string `~/mybin` in a variable `myvar`
  * List the contents of the directory using the variable.
  * Copy the contents of the directory to `/tmp` using the variable.

------
$ myvar=~/mybin

$ ls $myvar
hello   ls

$ cp $myvar/* /tmp
------

==== `PATH` Variable

There are two executables `ls` and `hello` in `~/mybin`. Perform the
following operations related to the `PATH` environment variable.

  1. Take a backup of the `PATH` variable.
  2. Invoke `hello`, the command will fail.
  3. Add the directory `mybin` to the end of `PATH`, invoke `ls` and
     `hello`.
  4. Add the directory `mybin` to the beginning of `PATH`, invoke `ls` and 
     `hello`.
  5. Restore your original `PATH`.

------
$ BPATH=$PATH

$ hello
bash: hello: command not found

$ PATH=$PATH:~/mybin
$ hello
Hello user!
$ ls
...

$ PATH=~/mybin:$PATH
$ hello
Hello user!
$ ls
custom ls from ~/mybin!

$ PATH=$BPATH

==== Finding Files

  1. Using `find` determine the locations of all HTML files under
     `/usr`.

  2. Using `find` determine the location of all directories called
