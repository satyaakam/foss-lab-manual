== Objectives

Introduce packages and package managements systems to students.


== Prerequisites

1. The student should be able to work in a terminal and familiar with Linux command line
2. The student should have some knowledge on compiling software and installing them in Linux (not mandatory, recommended)


== Background

In the beginning systems administrators and users have to install new applications and utlities in Linux by compiling them from source. Compiling software and 
installing them from source has lot of draw backs. I have listed some of them below, 

1. The user/administrator has to install necessary dependend libraries and other helper software before actually compiling and installing the application from source
2. It is difficult to keep track the software installed on a system
3. It is difficult to remove the software once installed from the source. 
4. It is difficult to keep them updated


Enter packages and package management. The biggest advantage of package is, it knows the steps needed to install/uninstall itself on your system. 
What used to be a painful manual process is now a straightforward procedure. What used to be a mass of 20,000 files becomes a couple hundred packages.
A package manager keep tracks of the packages installed. It also keep tracks of what is inside a package.


For example the following command lists the files installed  by a particular package (in our case the kernel) on your system,
--------------------
rpm -qil kernel
-------------------
 

Package is a prebuilt opensource component. Normally 'package maintainer' of an application creates the package. If you are curious about how to create a package 
have a look at http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PackageMaintainers/CreatingPackageHowTo . Once the package is created, it is  published to centralized location 
called 'repository'. Repositories hold collection of packages and their metadata (metadata holds data about the packages available).
 

In a modern Linux distributions like Fedora, Debian, Centos, operations(update,remove,install) on a package can be initated by just specifying operation and 
the package name. The package manager will take care of all the dirty details.


There are numerous package managers available for Linux systems. Several of the package managers offer graphical front-ends, contain search capabilities, 
allow updates to be installed from remote locations, and provide E-mail notifications when new packages are available. One package manager that provides all of these 
capabilities is YUM __(YellowDog Updater Modified)__. This manual will provide an introduction to package management with yum.


== Installing software using yum

Before installing software using yum,

1. Make sure that your internet/network connection is working
2. If you are behind a proxy server, add __proxy=http://IPAddress:Port__ at the end of yum configuration file __/etc/yum.conf__
3. Make sure that you have appropriate permission to install the package (ask your system administrator)

Enough talk, lets install a package. Enter the following command,

--------------------------------
yum install sl
--------------------------------

Press 'y' when the command asks your confirmation, The output of the command should be

-------------------------------
[root@gnubox lab-manual]# yum install sl

Complete!
----------------------------

After installing the package, check whether the it is working my typing 'sl'

== Uninstall a package

Lets try removing the package,

--------------------------
yum -y remove sl
-------------------------

Note the '-y' option in the command, it instructs the 'yum' to assume 'yes'(y) to all the questions, You don't have to press the 'y' key.

[root@gnubox package-installation]# 

-------------------------------------------------

If you closely look at the above output, you can infer that the package 'sl' belongs to repository 'fedora'.


== Searching for a package

Lets try searching for some games in linux,

---------------------
yum search game
--------------------

-------------------------------------------
[root@gnubox package-installation]# yum search game
Loaded plugins: presto, refresh-packagekit   
============================================================================ Matched: game ====================================================

== Updating your system

Updates keeps your software free from bugs and crashes. Lets try updating the packages using package manager yum.

----------------
yum -y update

-------------------------------------

.Step 2:
      
Enable rpmfusion repositories if they are not enabled

-----------
rpm -ivh http://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-stable.noarch.rpm
rpm -ivh http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-stable.noarch.rpm
-----------

.Step 3:

Install necessary packages

--------------
yum -y install gstreamer-plugins-bad gstreamer-plugins-ugly xine-lib-extras-nonfree
yum -y install xmms,xmms-mp3
-------------

.Step 4:

Open an audio file and test the installation.


== Conclusion

In this lab session, we learnt how to use package manager to manage various packages in Linux.
