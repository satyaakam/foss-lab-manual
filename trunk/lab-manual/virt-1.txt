[[boot-freedos]]
==== Booting FreeDOS

.Step 1: Getting the disk image

The contents of the emulated hard disk is stored in a file. When the
guest system accesses the hard disk, the data is stored and retrieved
from the file. Download the disk image containing a FreeDOS
installation from http://fosslab/freedos.qcow2

------
[host]$ wget http://fosslab/freedos.qcow2
------

.Step 2: Booting the disk image

Start Qemu by specifying the FreeDOS disk image using the `-hda`
option.

------
[host]$ qemu -hda freedos.qcow2
------

.Step 3: Switching between host and guest

When the guest window is clicked, Qemu enters the "Grab mode". In Grab
mode, all keystrokes are sent to the guest. To exit Grab mode, and
give back control to the host press and release the `Ctrl-Alt` key
combination.

.Step 4: Shutting down the guest

After using the guest, the guest can shutdown like a normal system, by
issuing the OS' own shutdown command. In the case of FreeDOS issue the
`halt` command.

-----
C:\> halt
-----

==== Installing FreeDOS

.Step 1: Creating the disk image

The disk image into which FreeDOS will be installed is created
first. A 100MB disk image should be sufficient for the FreeDOS
installation. The `qcow2` format will be used, because of its size
advantages.

Create the disk image using the `qemu-img` command. The `create`
sub-command is to create hard disk images. The format is specified
using the `-f qcow2` option. The hard disk image file to be created is
specified as the first argument. The hard disk image size is specified
as the second argument.

------
[host]$ qemu-img create -f qcow2 hd.qcow2 100M
------

.Step 2: Get the FreeDOS installation CD

Download the FreeDOS installation CD available from
http://fosslab/freedos.iso

------
[host]$ wget http://fosslab/freedos.iso
------

.Step 3: Boot the FreeDOS installation CD 

The guest is booted from the FreeDOS installation CD and the installer
installs FreeDOS on to the hard disk. Start Qemu by specifying the
hard disk image using `-hda` option, the CD-ROM image using `-cdrom`
option. Now, since there are two bootable media - hard disk and
CD-ROM, the CD-ROM drive is specified as the boot media using `-boot
d` option. In the boot option, the hard disk is represented using the
drive letter `c` and the CD-ROM is represented using the drive letter
`d`.

------
[host]$ qemu -hda hd.qcow2 -cdrom freedos.iso -boot d
------

  1. In the installation CD boot prompt, press `Enter` to continue
     booting the installer.

  2. In the installer menu select `Install to harddisk using FreeDOS
     SETUP`, and press `Enter`.

  3. Select the language and keyboard layout as `English (US)`.

.Step 4: Partition the hard disk

The created hard disk image is like a blank hard disk, and does not
contain partitions. Atleast one partition has to be created to install
the OS.

   1. Select `Prepare the harddisk for FreeDOS by running XFdisk`, to
      start the partitioner.

   2. Select the un-partitioned free space, and press `Enter`, to open
      the `Options` menu.

   3. From the `Options` menu, select `New Partition` and press
      `Enter`.
      
   4. From the `New Partition` sub-menu, select `Primary Partition` and
      press `Enter`. 

   5. Specify the partition size as 100 and press `Enter`, to create a
      partition of size 100MB.

   6. Select `YES` in the `Initialise Partition Area` dialog box, to
      format the created partition.

   7. Select `YES` in the `Initialise Partition Area` dialog box, that
      appears again. For some reason unknown to the author, this is
      asked twice.

   8. Press F3 to quit the partitioner.

   9. Select `YES` in the `Write Partition Table` dialog box, to
      write the partition table to disk.

   10. Select `YES` in the `Restart Computer` dialog box. If after
      selecting the option the guest does not restart. Close Qemu, and
      restart Qemu with same command as before.

   11. When the system boots back, follow the 3 instructions in step
       3, to reach the installer menu.

   12. Select `Continue with FreeDOS installation`, to resume the
       installer.

.Step 5: Install FreeDOS

   1. Select `Start installation of FreeDOS`, to start the
      installation.

   2. Make sure you read the copyright notice and press any key.

   3. The installer prompts for the OS install path with `C:\FDOS` as
      default. Press Enter to accept the default. 

   4. The installer prompts for the programs to be
      installed. Check/uncheck programs as required using the `Space`
      key. Press `Enter` when done.

   5. The installer installs the OS and the selected programs.

   6. Enter `Y` when asked if the system can be rebooted. If the guest
      does not restart, close the Qemu window, and invoke Qemu by
      specifying the hard disk image alone.

------
[host]$ qemu -hda hd.qcow2
------

==== Saving and Restoring Guest State

.Step 1: Boot FreeDOS

First boot into the guest system, using the steps described in section
<<boot-freedos>>.

.Step 2: Save the guest state

The current state of the guest system can be saved using the `savevm`
command in the monitor interface.

  1. Switch to the monitor interface by pressing `Ctrl-Alt-2`.
  2. Save the guest state using the `savevm` command, with the tag
     `booted`.
+
------
(qemu) savevm booted
------

.Step 3: Restore the guest state.

The guest state can be restored using the `loadvm` monitor command.

  1. Switch back to the console using `Ctrl-Alt-1`.
  2. Make some changes to the filesystem by creating files.
+
------
C:\> echo hello > file.txt
------
+
  3. Go back to the monitor interface and restore the guest state
     using the `loadvm` command.
+
------
(qemu) loadvm booted
------
+
  4. Go back to the console and check for the file `file.txt`.

.Step 4: Start from saved guest state.

   1. Shutdown the guest system using the `halt` command.

   2. Start the guest system using the saved guest state, by
      specifying the `-loadvm` option to `qemu`. The option accepts
      the tag as argument.
+
------
[host]$ qemu -hda hd.qcow2 -loadvm booted
------
