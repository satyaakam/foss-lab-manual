FOSS Manual Contribution Guidelines 
===================================
Vijay Kumar <vijaykumar@bravegnu.org>

== Top level Structure

  * The manual has been split into three parts
    - Instructor Manual (dir. `instructor-manual`)
    - Lab Manual (dir. `lab-manual`)
    - Study Material (dir. `study-material`)

  * The Instructor Manual is for lecturer handling the lab. Setup to
    be done in the lab for a certain lab sessions, etc.

  * The Lab Manual is for the student during the lab session.

  * The Study Material will be a collection of reading material, that
    the student has to read before each lab session.

== Lab Manual Structure

  * The Lab Manual is split into chapters one for each topic mentioned
    in the syllabus. The chapters are level one sections in
    AsciiDoc. The following example shows to chapters "Python" and
    "Perl", as level one sections.

-----
== Python
...
...
== Perl
...

-----

  * Each chapter is split into lab sessions. Each session covers the
    activity to be performed in one 45min lab session.

  * The no. of sessions for each topic is mentioned in `sessions.txt`.
    
  * Each session should be a AsciiDoc level-2 section in the
    `lab-manual/lab-manual.txt`. See the following for an example.

------
== Python
=== Session 1
...

=== Session 2
...
------

  * A session should have an objective, which describes what the
    student will learn by the end of that lab session.

-------
=== Session 1

==== Objective

  * Learn how to configure an IP network of two computers.
  * Learn how to configure an IP network involving 2 link layer networks.
  * Learn how to configure an IP network involving 2 link layer
    networks and backbone network.
-------

  * For sessions based on programming languages it is better to have
    examples and exercises. Detailed explanation of the programming
    language

  * For sessions involing sequence of commands, list the sequence of
    instructions be performed, and give exercises to change the
    sequence in minor ways to acheive different results.

  * The main file for Lab Manual will be `lab-manual/lab-manual.txt`.
    Each session will be in a separate file and will be included from
    `lab-manual/lab-manual.txt`, using AsciiDoc's `include` macro.

  * The sessions files will be named
    `<session-name>-<session-no>.txt`. Example `python-1.txt`,
    `kernel-2.txt`.

  * Please do not create sub-directories within `lab-manual/`.

== Study Material Structure

  * The study material is also structured like the Lab Manual.

  * The study material for each lab session will be provided under the
    lab sessions' sub-section.

== Formatting

  * The manual is to be written in AsciiDoc format. Please see
    http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html for the
    AsciiDoc's User Guide.

  * When you refer to filenames, variables, functions, keywords,
    etc. from your code put them inside backticks like `\`printf()\``
    This will render the text in monospace.

== File Naming Guidelines

   * File names should be all lower case. Keeping the files in the
     same case helps. 
  
   * Words in the filename are to be separated by a hyphen. The hyphen
     is preferred over space, underscore and camel-casing.

   * Please avoid spaces in filenames.

== Coding Standard

   * Please follow the appropriate coding standards, while writing
     example code.

   * For Python code, Python's PEP 8 coding style will be used. The
     coding style document can be accessed from
     http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

   * For C code, the Linux kernel coding style will be used. The
     coding style document is available in the Linux kernel source
     tree. It can also be accessed from
     http://lxr.linux.no/linux/Documentation/CodingStyle

   * For PHP code, FIXME: I am not sure. How about
     http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.php ?

   * For Perl code, the coding standard mentioned in the Perl style
     guide will be used. The document can be accessed from
     http://perldoc.perl.org/perlstyle.html will be used.

== Contributing

  * Before writing for a session in the manual. Please send a mail to
    foss-lab-manual-dev@googlegroups.com mailing list with the
    objectives of the session, a gist of the examples and exercises to
    be provided. Ask for feedback, discuss it over and then move on to
    writing the session.

  * Please do not commit generated files to SVN. Only the AsciiDoc
    text file should be committed the HTML file *should* not be
    committed to SVN.
